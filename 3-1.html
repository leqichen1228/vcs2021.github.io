  ["<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Luiza: I want to ask about the importance of iterations and sketches, and with the first project, you know as sort of a requirement of the project is so long you had so many iterations that kind of showed you the way into something at the end that maybe you couldn't even have predicted so what's the importance for you in your practice of sketching and thinking through making?</a>", 
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Lucille: We had 12 more weeks to make something, and this was our thesis kind. This is our pieces; in a way, I felt like we were prepared and not prepared because we thought, OK, we're going to be launched into the world now in a few months. I'm going to graduate with an MFA in design. I'm going to get a job, but why is this project be given to me at this time in my life? You know when I have to go out the streets what is that about. So for the remaining 10 to 12 weeks, I thought, Lucille, if you go there at night, what are you going to notice. If you go there in the day, what are you going to see? </a>", 
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Lucille: In the way, that's iterative because the conditions change all the time; it wasn't the same when I got there. But, of course, you know I was like on the other side of the road can you imagine I would I have a different vantage point I would stand in the middle of the island to Lane Drive it is a big road if you go back if anybody has a chance to go to Detroit.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Lucille: Still, it's outside of Detroit on Woodward Avenue, which is the main thorough for it that goes out of Detroit to the suburbs where Cranbrook is worse. So just those of vantage point across the street, I across the store which is very close and then in the middle of the road highway that gives you different vantage point also looking in your left and right and I think that's what's missing. Luiza, you're asking me how one does generate sketchers, iterations if you're only on one screen because that is the mediator of your design.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Lucille: You don't stand up. I'm not standing up looking sideways; I can't, so do I go in the back? I can you know because I only have one screen. Hence, I feel that might I have to tell my students and you know I'm not going back you know I'm not going to let you go back to the past right because at the time, 40 years ago we didn't have a computer, so that's all we did.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Lucille: Still, now that you have the laptop, you have the computer. How can you break away from that by opening yourself up to what part is possible, so you know, maybe you're just going to go out and walk in and walk the street because you could come back. It'll be a different reception. Scan your images. I have to say I love accidents. I love when things aren't unplanned, and I have done that when you know, of course, when you're manually putting things and putting things together, items drop on your board, and that's looking interesting.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/619035342/aaf88b86d6'>Lucille: And now that's happening on me and the laptop. I'm like, oh, I'm moving it from one area. Wait a minute, let me stop right there that I like that how did that happen you know, you know there was an accident it's not an accident if you if you're welcome the accident, then you are onto something that is like taking risks.</a>"

  [ "Hannah: I'm not familiar with the director, but Cate Blanchett's acting can truly be described as one person holding a film together. She plays 13 roles in the film alone, pointing to 13 artistic genres of the 20th century. In different roles, her makeup, tone of voice, intonation, accent and temperament are all very different. As I watched, I wrote the words for these feelings based on the scene.Cold, anger, power, complex, dream, young, hope and etc.While watching, I felt that such a full screen expression, really tested the level of the actress. Besides, I think not everyone is suitable for the film, including myself. I really can't evaluate this collection very well with my art accumulation.",
  "Lena: Manifesto is made for those who are keen on exploring the philosophy of art and creation. For people who don’t belong to this group, like me, it was hard to follow. I saw fragments of different characters played by the same person positioned in different scenes. Through these distinctive personas, I feel that she wants to deliver some message, but many words are too poetic to be convincing. I think it would be easier to understand if the fragmented pieces could be connected in some way. But there are still some impressive scenes. The one that Cate talks to Cate in the news was quite intriguing to me. In the form of conversation, one talking to herself, I feel like her argument was strengthened. It also has a sense of humor to talk about such an abstract idea of “conceptual art” in the rain, which was faked though.",
  "Maud: Knowing nothing going into this movie, I had several realizations while watching and trying to understand what was going on. The first one was realizing that the dialogue was actually the manifest itself. Then realizing that the people we see were not actually the writers of the manifesto performed (seeing as the settings were all modern). And the last realization came when I actually recognized some of the dialogue performed and then understood that there was not one manifesto per character but rather several manifestos being mixed. This last realization came at the end of the movie, which made everything even more absurd than it already was. The fact that I didn’t even recognize a difference in the dialogue, maybe says something about how similar all these manifestos sound, and that when you take them out of their time and context it gets impossible to try to understand what they are trying to say. But while at the same time feeling a sense of absurdity, there was also something nice about seeing these very ambitious and grand words being performed by “normal” people.",
  "Antoinette: The opening of the movie sets a great tone of what this movie is about: the first manifesto stating that 'I do not explain because I hate common sense. I am writing a manifesto because I have nothing to say'. Julian Rosefeldt created this movie as his own manifesto, having nothing to say but to express his ideology visually and conceptually. The careful selection of manifestos all revolve around the main theme of art and authenticity. “We seek truth, not in the reality of appearances, but in the reality of thought. We must create.” This was especially interesting since Cate Blanchett skillfully delivers her out-of-context lines so strongly in character. The movie begins and ends with the same persona: a homeless person with a touch of madness saying “To those who don't understand us properly, we say with an irreducible scorn, we of whom you believe yourself to be the judges, will one day judge you”, echoing the first manifesto at the beginning of the movie.", 
  "Yiyao: After watching the film, I wasn't too impressed, probably because I didn't fully understand the director's ideas. I only remember that some manifestoes resonated with me during the watching process, so I went back and looked for those ideas. I think the one I identified with most was the manifesto during the theater performance. 'The more we know, the less we understand, the better it is. I welcome whatever happens next.'A rtwork is often a reflection of the social, economic, political, and many other aspects of the time in which it was created. When we look at artworks from different countries and regions, we can feel the difference, as if we were experiencing a different life. The difference in technology and cultural background makes the artists have many other methods and ways of creation.",
  "Austin: The Manifesto film was definitely not what I had expected going into it. I think I was expecting more of a documentary style piece about manifestos. The structure of the film was quite interesting with the 13 different segments with different characters played by Cate Blanchett. The film was quite thought provoking at times with some humor as well. I enjoyed how the piece moves between time periods. I couldn’t help but think that the film medium didn’t quite work for the piece. The film felt a little long at times and in some places, it was easy to lose interest. I think that the art video installation for this piece at the Smithsonian might be more successful. ",
  "Maria: In Manifesto, Cate Blanchett acts as 13 different characters who each recite famous manifestos in unexpected ways and contexts. It took me a little bit to realize that the dialogue consisted of different manifestos but once I did I could focus more on the delivery and setting of them (also thanks to the subtitles). I was particularly interested in the pairing of each manifesto with each speaker and setting. Some were exceptionally paired like the Dada Manifesto + Funeral Speaker, and some seemed more absurd like the prayer scene with a mother reciting the “I Am for an Art” manifesto. I felt like the delivery and context of each manifesto was crucial to how I perceived its content, it added a new layer of information that has to be unpacked.",
  "Claire: I think “Manifesto” is a unique movie - it's different from movies I've seen before. However, sometimes I found it a little difficult to follow because the different characters were constantly changing and all had extremely different „thoughts' '. Sometimes the manifestos were kind of intimidating, sometimes a little amusing, sometimes very extreme. But the focus was always on art. It was very interesting how image, sound and word interact here. Sometimes sound and pictures supported the word. Sometimes images and words created contrast. I found this form of a manifesto very interesting. (& another thought - how fascinating that each of the characters was played by the same actress and each time she looked like a completely different person? The make-up artist did a really good job! The actress as well.)"
