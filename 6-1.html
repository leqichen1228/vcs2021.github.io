  ["<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Tegwen: How do you approach, as you know, with TickTock or something very fast messages like there was a moment in the lecture when you said want to make the people do the work, see how they want to go through these documents in terms of things are going how fast pace and how peoples attention spans are so low, how would you approach this like a digital space I guess or interactive things?</a>", 
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: I think if you're trying to do anything and that is a little bit different or maybe trying to be a little bit critical or a little bit sort of like the terms that I was using in the talk like a resisting or pushing back or refusing something if you're trying to do that and you wanna work digitally I think it's imperative to think about the platforms that you're using, to consider taking something from one platform and maybe translating it over to another.</a>",
   "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: Suppose you just make another story to add to your Instagram or another TickTock video. In that case, it's very very hard like you're saying to stand out to catch anyone's attention. It's the entire businesses and economies are piss on how to grab attention into maintaining and sustaining attention rather than going down that route you might think about what can I do differently on this platform, how might I take something that I've made by hand and put it there or take something from this digital space and bring it over here and put it on the wall or turn it into a scene I'm not saying that's the only way to do it. Still, I know that when you,  and I've seen it this again. Again when you translate from one platform to another from one space to another there is a kind of defamiliarization happened that make people think twice, maybe about what their experience is, the surprise is involved.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Lucille: Pual I wanted to ask something about your initial forays into doing those initial books that started with the London Olympics 2012 because obviously, you have a reason for choosing the cities that you want to do the work, but also I'm interested in finding out how they perceive you as somebody being parachuted in the place, you know you're not from there right, but I love that picture where you were saying that everybody who get you gave the book to because they were limited run you engaged with them and whatever form it was, but it was a kind of Townhall or a book signing whatever it was was interesting to me but I think more than anything if they see I was interested in the dynamic of you choosing to the city and what you how you are perceived as an American artist coming in then I mean are you used to seeing or how do you ingratiate yourself.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: These were strange projects, I'll tell you, for all the reasons that you're bringing up here because selecting them I'm not sure how interesting that was because I didn't really know, I was just kind of picking and choosing opportunities if they came my way, I heard about this art festival I applied I got in, and I said oh no, what do I do, I don't know how to do this project, I don't know what to do, so thanks for little bit random in terms of how I was selecting things, at the start of those projects. but what you're talking about with the dynamic was very complex actually because I would get there. </a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: It was a year-long project, and I was spending a couple of weeks they're here and there, not a ton of time but enough to get to know people there and when I came back with the books, I started passing them out. During the 12 days of the Olympics and the sailing competition, there was a lot of media attention. So here i am riding around the bicycle,  just like going up to people. It's kind of foolish to look back right now.</a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: But an exciting thing happened, people started to take notice. People who lived in the town noticed me and began to look for me each day because they wanted another book. After all, every day it was like another line, and certain people started collecting on and actually like seeking me out. Then some people started giving me things back, they were like, oh, you are giving me these books and here is something I brought for you. It was really quite sweet actually that I started building at this collection. I came back with all of these poems, books, and artworks people are giving me.  </a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Luiza: Is it fascinating to see the transition of the talk between starting where you were kind of is that an imposing your practice on the on this new public and trying to see how that works to a very localized practice with residence, I was just reading this book called seeing like a state I don't know if you know about this, this idea like he talks about organizing society and how progress techniques such as mapping which are very visual serve to organize very clearly and cleanly which is very legible for the visitor, but not necessary for inhabitants, so it definitely feels like to me now you're kind of with inhabitants, and i really like the aspect of low- celerity of the work, but i want to ask you, Working within the institution to trying to kind of break it in a way or like particularly with your urgent lab, how did that work? </a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: it's an ongoing struggle, I would say, I think it's another question that keeps coming up, should you be inside the institution and reformat, it goes back to this idea of the burning house, do you stay in the burning house that's burning to the ground and attempt to put out the fire or do you leave and build a new structure somewhere else, right now I'm doing both, and it's really hard you know I'm literally in a touring every day between being in the burning house and trying my best in the face of some enormous challenges. </a>",
  "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: Being challenged by racist hiring practices and racist Valley is going back 150 years and coming to terms with them right now, so being challenged there and then driving across town to a studio, we were trying to create something new with a fresh start building something from the ground up as you say focused on locality and hopefully in ways, we're trying to Decenter authority, hierarchy, whiteness, you know it's not always perfect, but we're trying, and it's a really it's a beautiful space to try to like experiment with these ideas.</a>",
   "<a href='https://vimeo.com/amtparsons/review/639774176/9f853ad5f7' target='_blank'>Paul: I'm finding that inside of the institution it's challenging to experiment with any of these ideas, I think the students appreciated it enjoyed it, but it was also really stressful because there's an expectation I think you all have to come into sometime, you come to a class, expect the teacher tell you what's going to happen in studio that day， what if you went into a studio and the professor said what should we do today, that became we did that every week for almost a semester and that became a kind of pressure that was at once liberating and incredibly stressful for a lot of us including me and I'm not sure I would do it again but it was a good learning experience.</a>"

  "Carla: Paul Soulellis, known as an artist and educator, 'I've been looking for queer typography. Is anyone else out there? Who else is searching? I wonder if this is even a valid question.'. He is committed to non-profit organization that supports artists, writers, and activists with access to space, tools, and other resources for queer publishing. His practice includes teaching, writing and experimental publishing, with a focus on queer methods and network culture. Before the prosperity of online media, traditional media displayed mainstream social culture. Compared with marginal cultures such as queer culture, they have been struggling in social culture. The emergence of online media uses its temporal and spatial virtuality and the authenticity of audience perception. To make queer culture spread among the public, and have a huge impact on the identification of queer identity, the development of queer cultural practice activities and the public's acceptance of queer culture.",
  "Antoinette: I remember talking to my friends about how Design is not the most accessible career path to many, since you need to first own a functioning computer with power and internet as well as multiple software tools, and then the investment in time to learn and practice the tools and the theories. It was interesting to read about how the 80s and 90s publication especially in the gay and lesbian liberation context reflects the limits and inequities and homemade design as a form of survival. I never thought about typographic rules being analogized as a political system to be rebelled against. I appreciate the open invite to creating good trouble, and hope more designers and creatives can acknowledge their power in not conforming to systematic conventions.",
  "Austin: Going into this week’s reading, I knew nothing about queer typography and nothing of Paul Soulellis’ work. After familiarizing myself with his work, I was particularly drawn to the importance of typefaces and how fonts “frequently uphold and support imperial power” as he references the recent CIA rebrand. I also found it interesting how expansive the idea of queerness is and just how difficult it is to define it.", 
  "Maria: Paul Soulellis is searching for other histories in the realm of typography that don’t focus on what's expected or considered successful. Instead he’s interested in ways to resists these ideals by creating queer work. From a very young age we understand through cognitive experience how typography should work and the purpose it serves, never questioning its political implications. It’s obsession with control, legibility and precision became the standard and therefore categorized what diverged from this norm as 'bad design'.",
  "Lena: For Paul Soulellis, using metaphors like rainbow is not enough for queer acts. He argues that “the use of metaphor here shuts things down and fixes them into place.” But he also acknowledges that there is always “an idealized reading experience” as an expectation that most people hold. I think it’s always easier for us to distribute an idea with graphic symbols because they are more explicit than typographic ones. It’s the problem of legibility and the time people are willing to spend on it. The “secret languages” are only eligible to their specific community. When can we be confident enough that people would listen and try to understand, to “perform deviant acts of design in the face of conformity”?",
  "Hannah: I have never known or heard of queer typography, so reading this article has given me a little insight into it. I think I will continue to learn about it in the future.The article says”This was stated to me in another way by type designer Robin Mientjes, who said that when asked what they thought queer design was, replied: attitude. 'And I think that covers a lot of what queerness means: an attitude in the face of conformity, an attitude in the sea of passivity, an attitude to say yes when others say no. And that’s poetic and abstract, but that’s fine for our thesis today.'In my understanding, attitude is important. Many times we are so insistent on doing what is right in the eyes of others that we forget what we really want to do in our hearts.",
  "Yiyao: I think queer typography, like sexual minorities, has the meaning of breaking traditional stereotypes. In my opinion, this meaning is a kind of progress, which is critical thinking under different issues, for not just obeying the masses. It is also this liberation of nature that allows our society to have more possibilities. Secondly, I think queer typography and sexual minorities are also a relationship of mutual achievement, queer typography helps sexual minorities be more visible in society, and the theme of sexual minorities also helps queer typography have more meaning besides the visual difference."
