(function newFact7() {
  var facts7 = 
  [ "Maria: Laurel Schwulst defines a website as a “file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere,” this is a very simple yet accurate definition. When I’ve worked on a portfolio/personal website in the past I have always felt like it is something that needs to be finished before being shared. Schwulst defies this idea and states that a “website or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished” and “that is the beauty of it.” The metaphor of thinking of websites as a plant and how they can’t be rushed essentially encourages creators to enjoy the process and think of it, regardless of the outcome, as personal growth.",
  "Carla: The understanding of location is inseparable from three aspects: land, history and culture. The three seemingly unrelated parts are inadvertently integrated, affecting the composition of the place and the people living in it. The land is an important basis for life. Life is not limited to people but also includes plants and animals. The story that happened on the land is an important memory of people, and it is the history of this land that affects people's thoughts. Culture is often understood as defining what a place means to people. The location provides a carrier for history, and history promotes the formation of culture. ",
  "Maria: Frank Chimero writes about the experiences and conflicts he faced while working with tech, more specifically web development. The more he worked in the field the more his curiosity would diminish, almost leaving him with a feeling of disappointment. He goes on to find new ways of thinking about the web and makes a comparison with art, specifically David Hockney’s photographic work (which I thought was incredible). This was an interesting comparison and I understand the point he is trying to make. However, I don’t think creators need to decide whether or not to treat the web as a blank canvas or a material to build with. Take Hockey as an example again, he made these photographic series and then went back to making paintings on canvas, probably did more experimenting with material but didn’t have to define how his practice will treat the material for good. ",
  "Maud: Frank Chimero’s text. gives a good understanding of the importance of designing with content first, and responsive design. When designing for web and mobile it is also important to know the limitations of the web. I agree that Apple’s product pages used to be a pain back in 2015, but I think they have improved a lot. Either they learned from their mistakes, or computer and network power just improved so that we’re now able to scroll without disruption. The current pages work smoothly and give a great experience of the product. Frank wrote about Apple’s website that “It is fascinating that you can do that, but it’s really not what a website is supposed to do.”. But I feel like this sentiment clashes with his praise of Hockney who used photography in a way that he probably wasn’t “supposed to”, so it made me a little confused about what he was trying to say.",
  "Maya: Frank goes over designing for the web and how to manage content based on your constrictions. He uses an awful lot of videos to communicate his point, but I did find them helpful. He calls out how we expect technology to solve our limitations but sometimes it can produce more than them. Laurel goes over her definition of a website and why we have them. Things I honestly took for granted and never actually thought about. ",
  "Antoinette: I have a vivid memory of being on the computer one day after school, logging onto Neopets to collect the daily collectibles and to play some games – just to have my game interrupted because my mom received a call on the landline. Frank’s audio at the beginning of his post The Web’s Grain evoked the feeling exactly like how described it, “a shot of whiskey” being the perfect metaphor with the sense of age to it. Having been working on multiple projects that have to (at least conceptually) live in a digital framework over the past months, I thoroughly enjoyed this pair of readings — as a kind of reality check to recalibrate our approach in designing for the web. The two different ways Chimero and Schwulst dissect what a website is are simple, and effective in reminding us to not overthink; a quietude for meditation we need in the constant digital cacophony, where we could easily get lost in the aggressive elbowing for attention.
